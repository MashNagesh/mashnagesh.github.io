  Neural Network is one of the ways to make a machine learn from data and is a type of Machine Learning technique.There are multiple Machine learning techniques but the power of the model is limited by the choice of algorithm say a decision tree algorithm or a Bayesian algorithm. In Neural netowrks there is no specific associated learning algorithm i.e the rules of learning are not explicitly mentioned and hence it gives the power to identify non-linear patterns in data where the relationship between the input and output is not straightforward.
  
  A simple neural network is illustrated below along with snippets of Python code.
