title: "Intuition behind dot product of Input and Weight matrices in Image Classification"

 What happens when we do a dot product of the weight matrix and the input matrix?
 Let us assume that the network is completely trained and the weight matrix is learnt for each of the classes(say Rose/Leaf/Sea)
 For the sake of simplicity we are dealing with an image of 1 pixel(R,G,B) i.e a 1x3 vector.
 The learned weight matrix for the classes is of the dimension 3(denoting RGB values)X3 (each of the 3 categories).
